            <p>Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of TV; watching the Social Network movie and becoming so intrigued by how lines of code can genuinely make a huge impact and even change the world. Two days later, I taught myself HTML and CSS and developed my first website at the age of 13. I was insatiable.

This passion carried me to the point where I taught myself how to make IOS applications. I created over 800 apps until having my first successfully charted IOS application. After that, it was just a process of rinsing and repeating.

Software Development will be a passion I'll forever cherish. There's undoubtedly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am forever grateful I have the talent to do so.
